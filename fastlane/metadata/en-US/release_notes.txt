This is a very big update...here are a few important changes:

- The logic and data handling for the app has been totally rewritten so bugs are much easier to find and actually harder to create.
- The interface has also been rearranged a bit -- All user input is near the bottom (where your thumb is), and all outputs are at the top.
- The style of the interface is now different as well, please let me know what you think.
- The above benefits are also passed along to the Watch App which is faster and more optimized than ever.
- Best of all, there are now no more ads -- who likes ads??

As always, please leave a review
